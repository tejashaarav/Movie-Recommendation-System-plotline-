The fast expansion of data collecting has ushered in a new era of data. Recommendation Systems are used to produce more efficient systems using data. Recommendation Systems are a sort of information filtering system that improves the quality of search results by presenting things that are more relevant to the search item or to the user's search history.

They are used to anticipate a user's rating or preference for a certain item. Almost every big IT business has implemented them in some way.
In this project we use demographic filtering

Demographic Filtering- They provide users with generic suggestions based on the popularity and/or genre of movies. Users with comparable demographic characteristics receive the same movie recommendations from the System. The primary premise of this method is that films that are more popular and highly acclaimed are more likely to be loved by the general public.
